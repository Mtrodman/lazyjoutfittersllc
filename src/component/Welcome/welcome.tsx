                    Lazy J’s land has been in Emilee Burkett’s family since 1972. Lazy J manages and runs hunts on 
                    15,000 acres. 90% of that land is all family owned and has never been pressured by many hunters. 
                    Our owners and guides are some of the best around and have over 20 years of hunting and fishing 
                    experience in Kansas and surrounding states. Lazy J Outfitters isn’t here for personal gain. 
                    We’re here to gain friends and find repeat customers that want to hunt quality land and wildlife. 
                    Gene and Emilee are Kansas natives and have grown up in the Lyndon, KS area; making their knowledge of the land and wildlife 
                    that much greater.
